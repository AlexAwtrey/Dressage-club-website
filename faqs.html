            <h3>Do I need riding experience to join?</h3>
            <p>No! We welcome riders of all levels, from complete beginners to experienced competitors. Our coach works with each member to develop their skills at their own pace.</p>

            <h3>Do I need my own horse?</h3>
            <p>No, you do not need your own horse to participate. We work with local stables that provide horses for our lessons and shows.</p>

            <h3>What is dressage?</h3>
            <p>Dressage is often described as "horse ballet." It's a highly skilled form of riding where horse and rider perform precise movements from memory. Dressage develops harmony, balance, and communication between horse and rider.</p>

            <h3>How much does it cost to join?</h3>
            <p><strong>Competing members:</strong> $150 per semester - This covers club membership and IDA registration.</p>
            <p><strong>Non-competing members:</strong> $50 per semester - For those who want to participate in practices and club activities without competing in shows.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional costs:</strong> Lessons are separate and paid directly to the coach. Club funding through the university will help offset travel, show entry fees, facility rentals, equipment, and more!</p>

            <h3>When and where do you practice?</h3>
            <p>We practice at Simplicity Horsemanship. Check our Schedule page for the most current information, or visit our <a href="socials.html" style="color: #e87722;">Socials page</a> to book a lesson with Coach Kelley.</p>

            <h3>How do I compete with the IDA?</h3>
            <p>As a club member, you're eligible to compete at IDA shows. We'll help you register and prepare for your first show. Shows are held throughout the academic year at various locations.</p>
